# Plant Management ðŸŒ±

This application was created during the Rocketseat's Next Level Week 5 event.<br>
Plant Management is an app that helps users take care of their plants with notification alerts and some tips.

My participation in this project aimed to practice, improvement and learn about new concepts related to **React Native**.

### Technologies: 
[![React Native](.markdown/react-native.png "React Native")](https://reactnative.dev/)
[![Typescript](.markdown/typescript.png "Typescript")]([https://reactnative.dev/](https://www.typescriptlang.org/))

In addition to these technologies mentioned above, some other important libraries and tricks were used, such as **_Axios_** to HTTP requests, **_JSON Server_** to simulate data from APIs, animations, notifications, etc.

Check out the [project's official repository](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/nlw-05-react-native) on Rocketseat's Github for more information.
