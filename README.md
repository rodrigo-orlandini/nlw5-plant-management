# Plant Management ðŸŒ±

This application was created during the Rocketseat's Next Level Week 5 event.<br>
Plant Management is an app that helps users take care of their plants with notification alerts and some tips.

My participation in this project aimed to practice, improvement and learn about new concepts related to **React Native**.

### Technologies: 
* **_React Native_** with **_Expo_**
* **_Typescript_**

In addition to these technologies mentioned above, spme other important libraries and tricks were used, such as **_Axios_** to HTTP requests, **_JSON Server_** to simulate data from APIs, animations, notifications, etc.

Check out the [project official repository](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/nlw-05-react-native) on Rocketseat's Github for more information.
